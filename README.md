HTML Project For Odin Project

This project is to test my what I have learned regarding HTML from The Odin Project's "Introduction to HTML and CSS" course.

After finishing this project, I will have demonstrated I can set up a boilerplate HTML file, set up (potentially) multiple webpages that are anchored together, add text / images / lists, and be proficient at it.
